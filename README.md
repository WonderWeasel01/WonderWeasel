# WonderWeasel
Hi there! My name is Alexander and I am a studying as a developer at zealand denmark who started learning to code this year. While I am new to coding, I have been practicing UI design and Photoshop since 2019 and enjoy using my creativity to build visually appealing websites. In my free time, I love to play games and explore new technologies. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I am excited to share my projects and experiences with the community on GitHub.
